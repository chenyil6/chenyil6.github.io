### 2025
* **Huiyi Chen**, Jiawei Peng, Dehai Min, Changchang Sun, Kaijie Chen, Yan Yan, Xu Yang, Lu Cheng. [MVI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness to  Misleading Visual Inputs in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14159) (Preprinted, submitted to CVPR 2026)

The paper proposes MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and in-depth analyses provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs.

* **Huiyi Chen**, Jiawei Peng, Kaihua Tang, Xin Geng, Xu Yang. [Enhancing Multimodal In-Context Learning for Image Classification through Coreset Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14200)(ACMMM 2025, Oral).

The paper proposes a novel coreset construction framework, KeCO, for image classification tasks, aimed at enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models. KeCO leverages untapped data from the support set to aggregate category-relevant information into the coreset via feature-level updates. Notably, KeCO achieves strong performance in a simulated online scenario, demonstrating its practical applicability.


### 2024

* Li Li\*, Jiawei Peng\*, **Huiyi Chen**\*, Chongyang Gao, and Xu Yang. [How to Configure Good In-Context Sequence for Visual Question Answering](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_How_to_Configure_Good_In-Context_Sequence_for_Visual_Question_Answering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) (CVPR 2024, Poster)

The paper explores how to configure effective in-context sequences for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks to enhance the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Visual Language Models (LVLM). The paper elaborates on the role of different in-context configuration in LVLM and designs new configuration methods, providing valuable insights for optimizing LVLM’s ICL performance in VQA tasks.
